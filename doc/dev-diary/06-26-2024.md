## [erlbutt](https://github.com/cmoid/erlbutt)

I sometimes get obsessed with things, and the `SSB` immutable, append-only, signed log is one of them. I think it's the killer idea at the heart of scuttlebutt. This past year I haven't done much programming, instead I've bounced around a whole bunch of technologies trying to figure out what's next. I mean I even took up vim for a couple of months to see how others live.

This prototype was started [six years ago](%d5gv/qcOJiI2ow7VWpZ20LJASksEOtP4asjW28nMyvw=.sha256), which has to be a record for my longest side project.

Following [Cory's suggestion](%cH9X4ERD4yuKSwMFBxRVLVBOGEf2S290kzt1goUJcKk=.sha256), here's a dev-diary update:

I've got my tools upgraded to the latest erlang OTP27. It took a while to fix Distel, but that's good now and I'd like to see that as a foundation for [maxbutt](https://github.com/cmoid/maxbutt), an emacs client for `SSB`.

OTP27 introduces a native JSON module, so I've upgraded erlbutt to drop the dependency on Jiffy. [Jiffy](https://github.com/davisp/jiffy) was embedded as a NIF, and is awesome, I had to hack it slightly to accomodate the `SSB` quirky serialization. I still have to do that using the native JSON support, but it has callbacks so that I could write a custom [encode/decode](https://github.com/cmoid/erlbutt/blob/main/apps/ssb/src/message.erl#L213-#L279) function outside the module. I also took the opportunity to drop bitcask, which I was using as a simple key/value store to map messages to authors. Bitcask also works very well, it was built by Justin Sheehy at Basho, good stuff. But they are out of business and it broke in OTP27 so it was easier to just switch to DETS, another native module.

So now I'm back to zero :), or where I left off, which was fleshing out the various muxrpc call and slogging thru all the undocumented details of the reference implementations. I'm down to two dependencies, [enacl](https://github.com/jlouis/enacl), a simple wrapper for libsodium, and [ranch](https://ninenines.eu), for a socket pool. Ranch is all erlang and well written and supported. You can even buy support for specific releases. 99s really seems to get the open source model.
